<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable breathing circuits market consists of three main types: open, semi-open, and closed breathing circuits. Open breathing circuits allow exhaled gases to escape into the environment, making them suitable for surgical and emergency settings. Semi-open circuits feature a rebreathing bag, enabling partial gas reuse while still allowing some exhalation to vent. Closed breathing circuits completely recirculate gases, minimizing waste and enhancing efficiency, often used in intensive care and anesthesia. Each type caters to specific clinical needs and patient safety considerations.</p></p>
